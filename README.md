# [The Vintage Caravan]() **TO_ADD**

**TO_ADD**
'a classic hard rock of the 60's and 70's with a powerful attitude and a modern twist' ~ The Vintage Caravan.

Already a fan of The Vintage Caravan? You've have found the right place!
You don't know The Vintage Caravan? You are in the right place!
[The Vintage Caravan]() is the perfect place to discover the band as well as to get information, listen and buy their albums, be aware of their gig dates, locations and where to buy tickets, access to their merchandise store, no shows near you ask them to play in your city, etc...

I've discovered The Vintage Caravan totally by coincidence. My boyfriend and I were in a vintage clothing stores in Malasa√±a, Madrid's neighbourhood, when we listened a fantastic song we've never heard before. Since then we are big fan of the band.
We've personally saw them twice in live and there will be more for sure!
Go for it!

## UX  <a name="UX"></a>
This project is part of my [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Software Development studies, the **User-Centric Front-End Development** module. The objective of this milestone project is to *"create a static front-end website of at least 3 pages, or at least 3 separate page areas (if using a scrolling page)"*.

I have decided to create a responsive website using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 4 while having the opportunity to spread the world about this rock band full of humour with a bright future!
The purpose of this website is offering the user a centralised access to the band's information: discography, photos, event dates and locations, merchandise store, contact, etc.

### User Stories <a name="UserStories"></a>
**TO_ADD**

### Design <a name="Design"></a>
When it's come to The Vintage Caravan, I think about *Rock'n Roll music* and *Island* so this is why I have designed my project around the *starry night sky* with a splendid *Northern Lights* idea and dark colors.

#### Framework <a name="Framework"></a>
Bootstrap 4 - Because I've used Bootstrap in the past and I liked it and because it meets the project requirements *"Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout"* I've decided to build the website with Bootstrap 4.

#### Color Scheme <a name="ColorScheme"></a>
In keeping with the starry night sky with a splendid Northern Lights idea, I have chosen a dark color scheme. I first choose my background image, an [Aurora Borealis](https://www.pexels.com/photo/beautiful-cosmos-galaxy-milky-way-262662/) and then the following [html colors] (https://html-color.codes/) which work quite well with my theme:

- ![#fafafa](https://placehold.it/15/fafafa/fafafa) `#fafafa`
- ![#000000](https://placehold.it/15/000000/000000) `#000000`(*black*)
- ![#14171b](https://placehold.it/15/14171b/14171b) `#14171b`
- ![#495057](https://placehold.it/15/495057/495057) `#495057`
- ![#767676](https://placehold.it/15/767676/767676) `#767676`
- ![#ffffffa6](https://placehold.it/15/#ffffffa6/#ffffffa6) `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.65)`
- ![#00000080](https://placehold.it/15/#00000080/#00000080) `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)`
- ![#398339](https://placehold.it/15/398339/398339) `#398339`


#### Icons <a name="Icons"></a>

- [Font Awesome 5.12](https://fontawesome.com/)
 - I like the look of the Font Awesome's icons which meet my needs for this project.

#### Typography <a name="Typography"></a>

- I have opted to use the custom font [Dekar](https://www.fontfabric.com/fonts/dekar/) designed by Fontfabric throughout the application. I really like this simple and easy to read font with a vintage style which I believe fits perfectly with the band's style and the website concept. As a secondary font I have imported the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) called [Space Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Mono).

### Wireframes <a name="Wireframes"></a>

I have used [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) for my wireframes because:
- Code Institute have provided all students a free licence until end of 2020. I got to use this software a few year ago and I am pretty happy to get the chance use it again.
- The simplicity, rapidity and ease of use by focusing of structure and content.

My wireframes for this project can be found [here] (**TO_ADD**) in the wireframes sub-directory.
