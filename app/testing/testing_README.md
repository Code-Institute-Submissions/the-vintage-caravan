### Compatibility <a name="Compatibility"></a>

I tested the website across the 6 main browsers in both desktop and mobile configuration to ensure a large number of users can use it successfully.

- Chrome v.80.0
- Edge v.44
- Firefox v.73.0.1
- Safari v.5.1.7 on Windows 10
- Opera v.67.0
- Internet Explorer v.11

| All pages | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Safari | Opera | IE |
| :--- | :--- | :---| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Expected appearance | Good | Fair | Good | Poor | Good | Poor |
| Expected responsiveness | Good | Good | Good | Poor | Good | Poor |

- **Edge**: music page containers do not render as expected, the 3 containers with a staggered positioning in 2 columns are not harmoniously centered with each others. Album container size is reduced. Each links open in a separate new window.  

- **IE**: [Some CSS3 properties and HTML5 elements are not fully supported](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/browsers-devices/#internet-explorer)

- **Safari v.5.1.7**: Itâ€™s an outdated version and lacks many of the features present in the latest version of Safari. The last version of Safari for Windows was released on May 9, 2012.
